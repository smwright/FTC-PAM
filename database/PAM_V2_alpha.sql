Stop the bombs from falling at all costs!\n\nThere will also be Blenheim fighters from 254 Squadron in the air performing fighter sweeps, so check before you shoot! Timings will be given later.\n\nWe have been handed this map by a solider from 210 Field Company, Royal Engineers who returned to Dover yesterday. The black lines show how far the German forces have advanced since we were last over Dunkirk. They are closing in, especially from the East. \n\nThe red circles are areas that we suspect the Luftwaffe will aim for. Obviously the ships off the coast, the beaches and the areas where the BEF have concentrations of troops. The red marks on the map are the last know positions of the Royal Artillery AA positions.
