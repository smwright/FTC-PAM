      ACG's Rank system
    </h1>
    <p>
      ACG are not hung up on ranks, calling each other ‘Sir’ nor jumping through hoops in order to climb a virtual ladder
      which has little bearing on real life. Our ranking system is a uniform and has relevance in providing members
      with a guide to who is taking responsibility for ACG operations and organisation, and for pilots online with a guide
      to who should be in charge of any group at any given time. The system is based on what somebody brings to the group
      and demotion occurs as easily as promotion. Why should somebody who is always involved or contributing to the group
      sit on a low rank because somebody else signed up earlier?

    <h2>
      Rank levels
    </h2>
    <p>
      ACG pilots have the possibility to transfer from one faction to another during the course of their membership. ACG
      has introduced a rank level system in order to make the rank structures of different factions comparable. All new
      pilots come in at the lowest rank value.
    </p>
    <p>
      All new pilots come in at the lowest grade (Sergeant in the RAF and Gefreiter in the Luftwaffe) and all ranks are decided and approved by the commanding officer of the unit. This could be by recommendation from lower ranking pilots but will usually results from a commander observation over time. They will stay at the lowest grade until they show that they are active with the group and all this involves is getting involved and being a regular pilot. They do not have to be online all the time but always come into Teamspeak when flying to join up with squadron pals, weekly would be fine. Only if the pilot is clearly advanced then he may be directly promoted to Officer rank and avoid all of the NCO ranks. This is purely by decision of top brass/high command where all of the advanced qualities of an experienced virtual pilot are demonstrated. Always consider that ACG is an historical group and we try to maintain an historical balance in the ranking system so if someone is above you and doing their job you may find your route blocked, it may take extra efforts! If you are rank bothered then please don't be, it's just a part of our immersion, besides, officers are expected to do extra stuff, or they are demoted. Promotion is based on:
