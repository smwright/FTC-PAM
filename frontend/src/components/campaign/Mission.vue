        The list below shows all missions of {{ campaign.name }}. Each entry shows the real life date of the mission, itâ€™s

        <li><b>Briefing:</b> Briefings can only be seen by the associated faction. AARs can not be created or edited.</li>
        <li><b>Debriefing:</b> Briefings can only be seen by the associated faction. AARs can be created or edited.</li>
        <li><b>Closed:</b> After debriefing period has ended (usually one week after the mission has ended). Breifings can
          be seen by all factions. AARs can not be created or edited.</li>
