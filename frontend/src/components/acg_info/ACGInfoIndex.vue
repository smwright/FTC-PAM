    <p>ACG stands for Air Combat Group. “Air Combat” because we play flight simulator games that revolve around air combat,
      both historical and modern. “Group” because ACG is not a clan, squadron or squad, as groups of 10 or so players are
      usually called in online gaming and flight simulator communities. As in real-life Air Force squadron structure, a
      Group is a structure that has a number of squadrons under its command. This is the case for ACG, as it contains numerous
      individual squadrons, under a single command. So ACG is a kind of mix, between a traditional gaming clan and something
      akin to a historical re-enactment group.</p>

    <p>We are a laid back bunch of guys, we mix Allied and Axis as friends and our aim is immersion above everything else,
      right down to our friendly inter-squadron rivalry. Our pilots are interested in the history of World War II air combat
      on all fronts, seeking immersive air combat in the theatres of the time through historical campaign and other online
      activities. We create parity in theatre and achieve common ground across the group by supporting both sides of the
      conflict, ultimately we seek to mirror the numbers flying on each side and support increasingly large campaigns.</p>

    <p>The squadrons within the group are historically based and the missions we fly are selected for their historical accuracy
      whether on our public server or in campaign. Group and squadron objectives are to re-enact the history ahead of competition,
      to attempt to be a part of being there, to learn about some of the experiences that were faced by the young pilots
      who fought for their countries in World War II and to honour them by understanding more about what they had to face.
    </p>

    <p>Our objective is to provide an unpressurised, non-competitive and friendly environment in which to enjoy combat operations,
      whichever side a pilot prefers, and all standards are welcome regardless of experience.</p>
