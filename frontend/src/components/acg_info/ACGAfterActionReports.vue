      <h1 class="text-align-center">After Action Reports (AARs)</h1>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        After action reports for ACG missions are compulsory. Failure to submit
        a flight report following taking part in a campaign mission means
        you wonâ€™t be able to attend a mission until the report is  submitted and
        has been accepted.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-center">
        <b>Attendance = Flying the mission + writing the report</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Note that reports are part of the expectation and attendance is checked
        by reports. This means that pilots who fail to write their report did
        not attend the mission.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Reports should be submitted in good time.
        The reports and claims will be checked by adjutants and commanders.
        Comments and feedback will be provided if something is missing or not
        according to regulations. Pilots will be advised to alter their report
        and/or claims in such cases, the adjutants or commanders will provide
        assistance as required; failure to do so will result in the rejection of
        the report or claim. A rejected report is equal to no report, which means
        attendance of the mission will not be recorded.
      </p>
      <h3>How to submit an after action report</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Follow these instructions to submit or edit an After Action Report.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the 'Campaigns' section of this webpage.</li>
        <li>Select the relevant mission. Note: The mission has to be in 'debriefing' status.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Add new report'.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Required information</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The required information in the AARs is faction dependent, but includes for the most part:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The starting airfield, aircraft type, any claims (air or ground), the
          pilot and aircraft status at the end of the sortie.</li>
        <li>Overall report of what happened on the sortie (optional).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Claims</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Claims are based on what pilots remembered at the time, under no
        circumstances are pilots to use video- or game-recordings; it should be based on
        memory after the fact and any witnesses to claims. They are for
        historical immersion. Writing an After Action Report was part of the
        life as a fighter pilot.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Apart from the pilot status described below, pilots should write their
        report and claim what they think is correct. If this results in
        inaccurate claims, so be it. Pilots should be ready to receive feedback
        and comments on claims from the adjutants or commanders.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        If filing a victory claim, pilots should ideally add further information
        about it in the Synopsis field.
      </p>

      <h3>RAF claims</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The RAF uses three classifications:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Destroyed: (Dest.) Where an aircraft was seen to crash, to be on
          fire or where the pilot/crew was seen to parachute from the
          aircraft. Server messages are not good enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Probable Destroyed: (Prob.) Where the aircraft was not seen to
          crash but was so badly damaged that, in the opinion of the
          claiming pilot, it could not have reached safety.</li>
        <li>
          Damaged: Self-explanatory. Cannot be shared.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        RAF pilots do not necessarily need to have a witness.
        All RAF pilots are demanded to give a brief description for each
        victory claim. This description should include time, place, damage and
        fate of the e/a. The claim description is the bare minimum each RAF
        pilot has to write, pilots writing a full synopsis can include the
        description in their synopsis and do not have to write them separately.
      </p>
      <h3>LW claims</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The Luftwaffe uses two classifications:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Confirmed: (Conf.) Where an aircraft was seen by the claiming pilot
          and one witness to crash, to be on fire or where the pilot/crew was
          seen to parachute from the aircraft.</li>
        <li>Unconfirmed: (Unconf.) Where an aircraft was seen to crash, to be
          on fire, where the pilot/crew was seen to parachute from the
          aircraft.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The Luftwaffe did not have shared victories. LW Pilots that work
        together shooting down an e/a have to decide on who gets the claim. If
        this is not included, the victory is given to the highest ranked pilot.
        Only the pilot credited for the victory puts it into the claims-table of
        his report. The others may write it into the synopsis.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Victories in the LW are either confirmed or unconfirmed, the difference
        between both lies in confirmed victories need to have a witness. In both
        cases the pilot has to witness the e/a being destroyed or forced to land
        in enemy territory. Upon submission, the claims are submitted as
        unconfirmed. The witness, should the claiming pilot have named one, will
        be notified about the appeal. After the witness confirmed the claim, it
        will be registered as confirmed in the database.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Unconfirmed claims might be confirmed by ground units in very close
        proximity, supposed sufficient information about the incident is
        provided. Ground confirmations are accepted or rejected based on the
        exclusive judgement by the Luftwaffe Chief Adjutant.
      </p>

      <h3>VVS claims</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        VVS uses two classifications:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Confirmed: (Conf.) Where an aircraft was seen by the claiming pilot
          and one witness to crash, to be on fire or where the pilot/crew was
          seen to parachute from the aircraft.</li>
        <li>Unconfirmed: (Unconf.) Where an aircraft was seen to crash, to be
          on fire, where the pilot/crew was seen to parachute from the
          aircraft.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Personal Claims: Where the aircraft was destroyed by a single
          pilot. The victory is attributed to the claiming pilot only.</li>
        <li>Group Claims: Where the aircraft is destroyed by several pilots.
          The victory is attributed to all the pilots who took part in that
          mission.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The VVS did not have shared victories in the sense that the LW had them.
        VVS pilots who work together to shoot down an e/a put this claim down
        as a Group Victory. This means that the entire squadron (pilots who flew
        14in that mission) is credited with a Group Victory. The pilots can decide
        amongst themselves who will file the Group Claim. The others may write
        it into the synopsis.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Victories in the VVS, like in the LW, are either confirmed or
        unconfirmed, the difference between both is that confirmed victories
        need to have a witness. In both cases the pilot has to witness the e/a
        being destroyed or forced to land in enemy territory. Upon submission,
        the claims are submitted as unconfirmed. The witness, should the
        claiming pilot have named one, will be notified about the appeal. After
        the witness confirmed the claim, it will be registered as confirmed in
        the database.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        Unconfirmed claims might be confirmed by ground units in very close
        proximity, if sufficient information about the incident is provided.
        Ground confirmations are accepted or rejected based on the judgement by
        the VVS Chief Adjutant.
      </p>
      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The written synopsis of the action is optional. Pilots in German
        speaking units may also write this report in German if they choose to -
        translation is not required.
      </p>
      <h3>Technical difficulties</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        It is important to file a report as well should you discover technical
        difficulties during the mission that make it impossible for you to fly
        (for example launcher crashes, network disconnects, hardware jinxes
        etc.). This is the only way the effort to participate can be verified.
        Otherwiseattendance will be recorded as "did not participate" or "did
        not file report", both of which are not good.
      </p>
      <h3>Approval of AARs</h3>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The reports will be listed under the corresponding Squadron/Staffel on
        the mission page. Upon submission the report status is set to Pending,
        this means that the report waits for acceptance by an adjutant or unit
        commander.
      </p>
      <p class="text-align-justify">
        The status will be changed from Pending to Approved as soon as an
        adjutant or unit commander has accepted the report. The name of the
        adjutant or unit commander will be shown in the list as well as on the
        report itself. The report and its information are cleared for further
        use in the database once the report has been accepted.
