    <h3>
      Leadership
    </h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      ACG is run by its members. There is no strict hierarchical command structure per se, but a Board of Directors-type structure
      with supporting staff and members assigned to different management stations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The Board of Directors consists of five members:  one Chairman and four faction members, (two representatives for
      each side, who make up the High Command for each faction.  Our current organization structure can be found here:
      XXXX ACG Organizational Chart XXXXX
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Staff Office Leaders oversee and coordinate all activity in their area of responsibility. Staff Office Leaders have
      delegated authority to recruit members for sub-projects as needed, and to make decisions within their area of responsibility.
      This delegation relieves the workload of High Command, spreads out responsibility and streamlines the decision-making
      processes.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      All ACG activity outside of flying the Campaign and writing AAR's is done voluntarily. Everybody, regardless of experience
      or length of membership in ACG is encouraged to contribute in whatever way possible.
