    <h3>Campaign overview</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The campaigns are ACGs main event and centerpiece. Participation in the ACG Campaign Missions represents the core
      experience for ACG members. Each campaign is made up of several missions centered around a specific historic theater
      or battle. Participation is exclusive and mandatory for members, although it is open to interested people who would
      like to try it out before considering membership.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The focus of ACG Campaign Missions is <b>immersion</b>, <b>authenticity</b> and <b>enjoyment</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The missions are usually flown every Sunday at 1900 local UK time on the ACG server, using TS3 for communications.

      The ACG Campaign is open to interested people who would like to try it
      out before considering membership. New pilots are very welcome and no
      experience is necessary, however it is recommended that they make
      contact on the forum or in TS and join in a training night to help them
      be prepared and set up for the full Campaign Mission experience.
