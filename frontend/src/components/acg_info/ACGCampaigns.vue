      Campaigns
    </h1>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The campaigns are ACGs main event and centerpiece. Participation in the ACG Campaign Missions represents the core
      experience for ACG members. Each campaign is made up of several missions centered around a specific historic theater
      or battle. ACG is not using only one simulator, but several depending on which fits the specific historic theater best
      (IL-2 Cliffs of Dover, IL-2 Battle of Moscow, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad, ... ).
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The focus of ACG Campaign Missions is <b>immersion</b>, <b>authenticity</b> and <b>enjoyment</b>. It is not a competitive
      campaign, although the individual units of ACG fly against each other. The goal is ultimately not to amass victories,
      but to experience immersive and memorable sorties; sorties that give the participating pilots the feeling of being there.
      A sign for a successful mission is when the participating pilots of all units report back that they enjoyed the mission and
      had a enjoyable experience regardless of personal or unit success.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The campaigns are not necessarily balanced between the opposing factions, and mission or campaign goals might be different
      between the factions and units. One side might have a numerical or technical advantage over the opposing side.
    </p>
    <h3>Participation</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Participation is exclusive and mandatory for members, although it is open to interested people who would
      like to try it out before considering membership. New pilots are very welcome and no experience is necessary, however
      it is mandatory that they make contact on the forum or in TS and join in a training night to help them be prepared
      and set up for the full Campaign Mission experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Long term perspective on the campaigns</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Planning for an upcoming campaign starts normally about half a year before it's start. What theater and simulator will
      be used is decided in an ACG staff meeting based on proposed plans from the Operations Team. The Operations team then
      begins to extend their research on that theater. What battles to use, which historical units will the ACG units represent,
      and what aircraft will they fly. Once that's decided, skinners start with the creation of the aircraft skins, the mission
      builders start to create the base maps, artwork for the web page are created, etc...
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Each campaign is usually divided into batches of about six missions. Between two mission batches lies usually a two week break.
      The break is used for some R&R. A staff meeting is held at each first Sunday during a campaign break, in which all kinds
      of matters within ACG are discussed and strategic decisions are taken. Usually there's some fun and entertaining events
      flown, created by ACG members for ACG members. This is more or less a testbed to try out new ideas or just for silly fun.
    </p>
    <h3>General flow of the campaign each week</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      The campaign missions are usually flown every Sunday at 1900 local UK time on the ACG server, detailed information can
      be found in the campaign section of the web page. We are not able to fit all ACG members on the server at the same time
      due to technical limitations. A shift system is employed where each unit gets an approximate time to join the battle.
      This time is dictated by the mission designers and based on the scenario and server load.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Communications are done via Teamspeak on ACG's own Teamspeak server. Some factions use a channel system, others have one
      separate channel for each unit and communicate from unit to unit via whispers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Information on the join times and the communication channel setup, as well as the briefing for the mission is distributed
      to the members a few days before the mission via pm and the web page. This allows members and units to prepare and plan
      for the mission as they see fit, and to make sure that all technical aspects are in order.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      ACG provides a custom build software (TACGRAB) to allow automatic mission file download, as well as the download of
      all aircraft skins in use. However, this software is only in use for campaigns on the IL-2 Great Battle series.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Commanding officers and ACG members usually join in for a faction briefing just before the mission starts. This briefing
      contains some information about the historical background and the tasking and/or coordination between units. The members
      then join together in their assigned communication channels and wait until it's their time to join the server.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Each members then flies their mission. Each pilot has only one try for each mission and re-spawns are not allowed.
      That means a pilot is out as soon as he's shot down or needs to land. Naturally there's some exceptions to this rule
      should a pilot drop out due to technical difficulties. Some missions allow units to fly several sorties, this will be
      briefed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      ACG members are required to file an after action report for each sortie. They have one weeks time to do so. The AAR's
      are read and approved by the unit adjutant or CO. All victory claims are filed and registered through the AAR's  and
      they need to be written from memory without the help of server logs or video recordings.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      After that the cycle begins anew with the next mission.
