      Rules
    </h1>
    <h3>Participation</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Members are expected to attend "most" of the missions with prior notice of absences being notified to unit commanders
      / adjutants. Any difficulties in regular attendance can usually be negotiated with a member of staff. Members not
      attending the Campaign Missions, without informing their unit commander/adjutant, will be contacted via pm or e-mail
      about their status. Repeated unexcused absence and failure to respond to status inquiries will result in dismissal.
    </p>
    <h3>Attitude</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      This is an immersion campaign not a competitive campaign. Pilots will be
      assigned a task to do as a squadron and will be expected to carry this
      out as best they can. There will be no winners or losers, events and
      outcomes are recorded, as happened historically, through the After
      Action Reports. The character system and ‘single life’ rules are there
      to promote immersion and encourage realistic behaviour in self-
      preservation during missions.
