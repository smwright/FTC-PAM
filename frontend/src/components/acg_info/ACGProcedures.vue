      Procedures
    </h1>
    <h3>Game crash</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      In the event of an individual game crash pilots should consult their
      unit commander for advice on how to proceed – normally this will be a
      simple restart and re-join. This should not be abused – server stats
      will show where pilots have re-joined and these will be monitored.
    </p>
    <h3>TACGRAB</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      TacGRAB is an internally developed application that facilitates
      campaign and mission management when using the Il-2 Great Battles
      series as the game platform. All Campaign Mission participants should
      download and run TACGRAB prior to mission start.
    </p>
    <h3>Skins</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      TacGRAB automatically downloads all ACG skins and installs them into
      the correct folders. So any time a skin pack is updated, altered, deleted
      or newly uploaded, TacGRAB will detect this and download the skins that
      it is missing.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      TacGRAB currently only supports campaigns that use the Great Battles
      simulator. Cliffs of Dover Blitz uses a different system for
      distributing skins. In these campaigns individual pilots are only
      required to download and install their own skin in the appropriate
      folder.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Skin alterations, as for example the addition of nose art, need to be
      approved by the squadron commanders or high command.
    </p>
    <h3>Mission File Handling</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      TacGRAB allows for the automatic download and unpacking of IL2_BoX
      mission files pre-connection to the server and speeds up the server
      joining process. TacGRAB can download mission files in compressed format
      and un-compress and install them to the correct directory pre-join,
      saving an appreciable amount of time.
    </p>
    <h3>Pilot status after mission</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      A "pilot survival system" has been implemented on the ACG server. This
      means that if a (human) pilot lands, crash lands or bails out, there will
      be a message generated in the PAM Check your FATE tab of each mission,
      stating if he is in friendly, neutral or enemy territory and what his
      status is (returned to friendly lines, rescued, captured by the enemy).
      This will be used to exactly know (without guessing) the pilot's status
      at the end of the mission.
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      Players should not leave their aircraft or disconnect from the server
      until their pilot is safely on the ground when bailing out, or the
      aircraft has come to a stop, hit the ground etc. in order to allow the
      message to be written into the server log. If in any doubt pilots should
      contact their adjutant who will read the information from the server
      log. More information on this in section 5.3 (final reference needs
      checking).
    </p>
    <h3>Scheduling</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      A mission will be flown most Sundays. Every six missions there is
      usually a two-week break; additional breaks may occur due to holidays
      or external events. The Mission Schedule is here. Briefings are
      published to provide sufficient lead and planning time before a mission,
      typically on the Wednesday or Thursday of the mission week. Start time
      is normally 1900 UK local time. Spawn and briefing times will normally
      be published by the operations team in advance of the mission and will
      be displayed in the PAM, as outlined above.
    </p>
    <h3>In-game name and tags</h3>
    <p class="text-align-justify">
      ACG requires all members to set their in-game and Steam name to
      ACG_Adam (for example). On TeamSpeak they only need to set their name correctly, the
      tags are assigned via channel groups. The correct names in-game (ACG_Name) are required in order to not risk
      problems with Mission Controlling Software and for proper logging of attendance.
