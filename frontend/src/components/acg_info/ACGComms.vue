      <p>Our 150 slot TeamSpeak 3 server is where the ACG Campaign takes place.
        We gather here about half an hour before each Campaign mission to partake in one of ACG's oldest traditions, the pre-flight banter.
        This is our primary voice communication platform that we use for any group flying that we do.
        You must be on Teamspeak in order to take part in the Campaign.
        If you are interested in flying with others on comms don't be shy, jump in!
        We welcome like-minded flyers who like the immersion of squadron flying. </p>

      <p>ACG uses "Push-To-Talk" in as an anti-spam measure, you can set a Push-To-Talk key binding in the Settings>Options>Capture menu, then just use Teamspeak like a Walkie-Talkie.</p>

      <p>Once installed set up a Bookmark to Air Combat Group using the following connection details and join in.</p>
      <p>Apart from a Teamspeak 3 server, we also have a Discord server. This has proven to be a great way for our members to chat about life, the universe and everything.
        It is also particularly useful for asking quick questions about the game or the Group.
        We welcome all members of the flight-sim community to come in and chat with us! </p>

      <p>Paste the invite link into the Join Server window and join in. You can also use Discord in your browser by clicking the invite link, provided you login using a verified email address.</p>
      <p>Should you experience any problems please post in our forums and we'll be happy to help you out.</p>
