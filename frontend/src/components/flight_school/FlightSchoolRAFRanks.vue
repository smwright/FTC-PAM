    <p class="text-align-center">The RAF is not always logical and can sound, to the unfamiliar, like the rules of cricket as described on a novelty tea towel, so here is a short aide memoire.<br>This is how things worked in the real RAF during and around 1940. In ACG we do ranks slightly differently and we don't expect you to address ranks formally, of course. For more information on the ACG ranking system, visit this page.</p>

They are known collectively as "Erks" (a corruption of the word 'Aircraft') and were engineers, responsible for technical and general duties. The lowest grade was an AC2; also colloquially known as an "AC plonk".<br><br>The rank was introduced to the RAF in January 1919, replacing the rank prefixes of "Air Mechanic", "Private" and "Clerk" that had been introduced under Air Memorandum No 1 in March 1918.<br><br>There were three grades: leading aircraftsman (LAC), aircraftsman 1st class (AC1) and aircraftsman 2nd class (AC2). A similar grading existed for junior ratings in the Royal Navy. The rank of senior aircraftman (SAC) was introduced on 1 January 1951. </th>

          <th class="not-bold"><br>In the Royal Flying Corps, officers were designated pilot officers at the end of pilot training. As they retained their commissions in their customary ranks (usually second lieutenant or lieutenant), and many of them had been seconded from their ground units, the designation of pilot officer was a position title rather than a rank.<br><br>
            On 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the British Army, with Royal Flying Corps second lieutenants becoming second lieutenants in the RAF. Consideration was given to renaming second lieutenants as ensigns. However, when the RAF's own rank structure was introduced on 1 August 1919, RAF second lieutenants who were qualified pilots were redesignated pilot officers, a rank which has been in continuous use ever since.<br><br>
            In 1940 however, the rank of pilot officer does not imply that the officer is aircrew. The Station Catering officer may well be one. It is a rank, not a job.<br><br></th>

However, with the creation of the RAF's own rank structure on 1 August 1919, RAF lieutenants were re-titled flying officers, a rank which has been in continuous use ever since.<br><br>

          <th>Wing Commander</th>
          <th class="not-bold"><br>With the Naval Wing of the Royal Flying Corps adopting the name of Royal Naval Air Service on 1 July 1914, the Naval Air Service adopted appointments in addition to the naval ranks. Pilots wore insignia according to the appointment, not their rank. One of the appointments was wing commander, holding the rank of commander.<br><br>
            On 1 April 1918, the newly created British Royal Air Force did not initially adopt a new rank structure, with personnel continuing their prior services' rank and uniform. There were some changes in ranks but it was inconstant. In 1920, the RAF began using the rank of wing commander.<br><br>
            In the early years of the RAF, a wing commander commanded a flying wing, typically a group of three or four aircraft squadrons. In current usage a wing commander is more likely to command a wing which is an administrative sub-division of an RAF station. A flying squadron is normally commanded by a wing commander but is occasionally commanded by a squadron leader for small units. In the Air Training Corps, a wing commander is usually the officer commanding of a wing.<br><br></th>

            Although in the early years of the RAF groups were normally commanded by group captains, by the mid-1920s they were usually commanded by an air officer.<br><br>
            In the post-World War II period the commander of an RAF flying station or a major ground training station has typically been a group captain. More recently, expeditionary air wings have also been commanded by group captains.<br><br></th>

          <th>Air Commodore</th>
          <th class="not-bold"><br>On 1 April 1918, the newly created RAF adopted its officer rank titles from the British Army, with officers at what is now air commodore holding the rank of brigadier-general.<br><br>In response to the proposal that the RAF should use its own rank titles, it was suggested that the RAF might use the Royal Navy's officer ranks, with the word "air" inserted before the naval rank title. Although the Admiralty objected to this simple modification of their rank titles, it was agreed that the RAF might base many of its officer rank titles on Navy officer ranks with differing pre-modifying terms. It was also suggested that air-officer ranks could be based on the term "ardian", which was derived from a combination of the Gaelic words for "chief" (ard) and "bird" (eun), with the term "fourth ardian" or "flight ardian" being used for the equivalent to brigadier-general and commodore. However, the rank title based on the Navy rank was preferred and air commodore was adopted on 1 August 1919.<br><br>
            In the present-day RAF, air commodores typically hold senior appointments within groups, acting directly in support of the air officer commanding. However, during the inter-war period, and in the case of the contemporary No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group, the air officer commanding held or holds air commodore rank. In the Air Training Corps, an appointed air commodore holds ultimate authority over the cadet organisation as the Commandant Air Cadets. <br><br></th>

      <p>In general, RAF officers are referred to by their post or appointment, not their rank. This is probably a left-over from the Royal Flying Core days. The term "Boss" refers to any officer to whom you are directly subordinate, as in your Boss.</p>
