  <h1 class="text-align-center">Organisation</h1>
  <p>The basic unit in the RAF is the Squadron (Sqn), several of these make a Wing (Wg) and several Wgs, normally organized by task and area make a Group (Gp) and above that a Command. For example Kenley Wing is part of 11Gp (geographically gathered in the SE of England) and all the fighter Gps together come under Fighter Command. A further organisational complexity is the Station (Stn). This is the generic term for an RAF camp and not restricted to flying units or aerodromes. You could have any number of Sqns or even Wgs at a Stn. The Stn includes the administration, engineering and operations support for those stationed there.</p>
  <h3>The Squadron</h3>
  <img style="align-self: center;width: 70%; border-radius: 35px;" src="../../assets/images/flight_school_images/raf/raf-squadron-structure.gif"/>

  <p>Each Fighter Sqn is nominally 12 aircraft (ac) and 20 pilots. The Sqn is split into 2 Flights (Flts) and each Flt split into 2 Sections (Sect) of 3 ac each, also known as a "Vic" Squad is a US term as is an Element (2 ac).  Flights were normally referred to A and B, and colours applied to each section and then referred to as, for example, red leader, red one, red two.</p>
  <h3>The Wing</h3>
  <p>Each Wg is nominally 3 Sqn and 60 pilots. During the Battle of Britain a Wing would normally operate 2 of the squadrons out of the sector station and another on one of the sector satellite aerodromes.  For example, Kenley Wing had No.401 operating from Croydon and at the same time operate No.64 and No.615 from Kenley.</p>
