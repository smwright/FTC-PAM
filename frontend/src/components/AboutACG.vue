    About Us
    </h1>
    <p>
    We are a very laid back bunch of guys, we mix Allied and Axis as friends and
    our aim is immersion above everything else, right down to our friendly inter-squadron
    rivalry.

    ACG are not hung up on ranks, calling each other ‘Sir’ nor jumping through hoops in order to climb a virtual ladder
    which has little bearing on real life. Our ranking system is a uniform and only has relevance in providing pilots online
    with a guide to who should be in charge of any group at any given time, and even then it is pretty laid back. The system
    is based on what somebody brings to the group and demotion occurs as easily as promotion. Why should a new pilot who
    has a lot of experience and skill have to start at the bottom? Why should somebody who is always involved or contributing
    the group sit on a low rank because somebody else signed up earlier?
