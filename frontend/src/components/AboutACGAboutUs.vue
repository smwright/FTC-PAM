    About Us
    </h1>
    <p>
      We are an English and German speaking group located in Europe, the Americas and Australia and meet on our own Teamspeak 3
      server. Our pilots are interested in the history of World War II air combat on all fronts, seeking immersive air combat
      in the theatres of the time through historical campaigns and other online activities. By supporting both sides of the conflict we can create parity in theatre and achieve common ground across the group, ultimately we seek to mirror the numbers flying on each side and support increasingly large campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a very laid back bunch of guys, we mix Allied and Axis as friends and our aim is immersion above everything
      else, right down to our friendly inter-squadron rivalry.
